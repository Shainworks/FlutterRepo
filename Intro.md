## What is flutter
1. Flutter is an open source framework developed by google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.
Such as Android,Ios,WIndows and Linux.
2. Flutter uses Dart as the programming language.
3. Native code is the code which is compiled to run on an particular processor(Here in flutter it means that the understanding of codebase by a particular platform)
4. Here the flutter helps to convert(compile) The Dart programming language into native code depending on the platform we are using if it is for ios then the code will be converted into swift code.
5. Here the point to be noticed is that the flutter renders the app rather than the platform processor does so
6. We will use Firebase as backend to deploy our projects on server
7. i will be using android studio as the code editor so bye bye vs code fpr a while ;)
